# solana-pay-py

## The Solana Pay Python SDK

solana-pay-py is a Python library for facilitating commerce on Solana by using a token transfer URL scheme. The URL scheme ensures that no matter the wallet or service used, the payment request must be created and interpreted in one standard way.

solana-pay-py is based on the [`@solana/pay JavaScript SDK`](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-pay) and was made possible using the awesome [`solana.py library`](https://github.com/michaelhly/solana-py) for interacting with [the Solana JSON RPC API](https://docs.solana.com/apps/jsonrpc-api).
